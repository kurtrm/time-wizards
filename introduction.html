      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>A time anomaly has occured. There is a fracture in space time and you must fix this cosmic conundrum. My name is generic robot and a discrepancy in my subatomic-unilateral-colliding-konimeter has ruptured the delicate balance of space time. Time warp holes have been created and parts of my SUCK have been scattered. You must travel through these warp holes and retrieve my missing parts and fix my SUCK. Adventurer beware, these warp holes have an unknown destination and time period, so you must traverse carefully. The fate of space-time is in your hands, good luck! </p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>Your objectives are simple but will be challenging. You must traverse through each warp portal that will send you to an unknown destination during an unknown time period. My GPS has tracked missing parts from my SUCK that have been misplaced in these warp holes. After retrieving the parts, my auto-modulating-repair-function will fix my discrepancy and fix the time anomaly and time space will be back to normal.</p>

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>The controls are simple. In each warp hole you will be presented with a set of challenges to complete. Random monsters have found my parts and guard them. You must outsmart these monsters, defeat them and bring back my parts. They will give you three tries to defeat them and you must get at LEAST one try correct to advance. </p></div>
