## Description

Fracture is a browser role playing game. The player has found itself in a time conundrum where a mysterious time traveling robot has suddenly appeared. The robot is responsible for damaging time and was broken in the process. The robot tells the player that time is in chaos, "my Subatomic-Unilateral-Concatenating-Kaleidoscope has ruptured the delicate balance of space time." As a result, historical characters, monsters and locations have been all mixed up in the present time line.

The player has to travel through time warp-holes to retrieve the robot's missing parts and reassemble the robot. The player must help the robot fix itself by traveling to at least 3 different time periods where itâ€™s parts got lost. After the robot is reassembled it fixes the time conundrum and the story ends. Upon repairing the robot, the player helps restore time and saves the universe.
